_The world is full of wonder. Technology helps us explore it._

## Welcome
You have found my blog! Hopefully you may find something interesting here and enjoy reading or get an idea for something to explore. I will post various topics of things that interest me. From cyber to dystopian sci-fi or philosophy.

### Computer Nerd...
I am deeply passionate about cyber security, Linux, and understanding how systems work. I tinker on some small projects of various sorts. I hope to share a few things I find interesting here along the way.

### ...Driven by Curiosity
Through reading, tinkering, and exploring I seek to understand some of the complex systems and how things work. Often found digging through man pages or down learning rabbit holes of various STEM or security topics.

## Strong believer in Learn by Doing
Reading is interesting and a great way to find how things work. But to truly understand how something works and more often how to fix it when things go wrong, go break things! Learn what you did wrong, figure out how to undo it. You will understand how things are connected in a much deeper way when you get your hands dirty exploring how it works.
