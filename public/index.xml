      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those who like brevity, sometimes you just need to sit down and do something. A project may just be held back because you are getting stuck at square one. This site has been delayed not once, not twice, but probably 3-4 times now as school got busy, then work got busy, then school, then&amp;hellip; Truth is life is busy and personal projects won&amp;rsquo;t do themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make time for the projects you are interested in pursuing. Take time to start. Sometimes once it is started, its not so bad after all. Lastly, learn from what challenges come along the way. Perhaps you will discover a new way to approach that next project or do things differently to manage your time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
